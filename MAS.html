/*Eventually i need to populate this array with the countries in here - https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/LanguagesUtilities/Conceptual/iTunesConnect_Guide/Appendices/AppStoreTerritories.html. This way it is dynamic and if the list of countries changes I am not broken. 

//Here is what I am trying to do. When updates to the Fusion 360 is released to the app store, I often get asked the question has all the countries (or our top 10 countries got the update). I usually go to each store and keep refershing the page to see if the new version shows up. I want to automate this such that i run the html and get the report of which countries have the update and whic dont yet. 

//STUCK - I am able to get the "data" from the page but I am not sure how to parse just for the version number from this data.*/

  var countryCodes = ["AE","US"];

  var baseUrl = "https://itunes.apple.com/";
  var suffix = "/app/fusion-360/id868968810";

  var i = 0;
  var country = countryCodes[i];
  var url = baseUrl + country + suffix;

  $.get(url).done(function(data,status){
   console.log(data);
